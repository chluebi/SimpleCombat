# SimpleCombat

A website to run Tabletop RPG type combat in the browser for free. Created because I was frustrated with the existing offers full of ads and paid subscriptions. Nowadays I would reccomend [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo).

# How to Use
The website is fully static hosted on github [here](https://chluebi.github.io/SimpleCombat/).

# How to Host
It is just a static site. Host it however you want.
